# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Tic Tac Toe project is a simple implementation of the classic game using Python. The game allows two players to take turns and place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, with the objective to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The project includes a command-line interface for easy interaction, and the code is well-documented to facilitate understanding and future modifications. To explore and contribute to this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in the README file. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are welcome!
